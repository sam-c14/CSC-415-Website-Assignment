This Assignment is to showcase a custom site with html and a little bit of css
It contains three pages which are index.html, contact.html and about.html where index.html is the home page while the remaining two html pages are linked to the index.html
To test, clone th repo, Inspect the files and install live server on your VSCode or code editor, start it up and view in your browser
Cheers
